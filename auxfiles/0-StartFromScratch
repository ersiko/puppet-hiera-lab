STARTING FROM SCRATCH

We just configured a puppet master with some slaves. If you know what you're doing and want to experiment or test your modules, feel free to do so!

But if you want to start the lab, type "1" (just a plain number one) and it will checkout the proper git branch with the puppet configuration.
